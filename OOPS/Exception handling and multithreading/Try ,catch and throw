In C++, the try and catch blocks are fundamental components of exception handling. They allow you to gracefully handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code. Here's how the try and catch blocks work together in C++:

try Block: The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown within this block, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and the program searches for a matching catch block to handle the exception.
catch Block: The catch block is used to catch and handle exceptions that are thrown within the corresponding try block.
Here's an explanation of how this code works :

if (denominator == 0) { ... }: This conditional statement checks if denominator is equal to 0. If it is, it means division by zero is attempted, which is an invalid operation.
throw "Division by zero is not allowed.";: Inside the if block, a throw statement is used to raise an exception. In this case, a string literal "Division by zero is not allowed." is thrown as an exception. This simulates an exception with a custom error message.
catch (const char error_message) { ... }:* Following the try block, there is a catch block. This block is used to catch and handle exceptions that are thrown within the preceding try block. It specifies that it can catch exceptions of type const char*, which is the type of the string literal thrown earlier.

** ANSWER ** 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        // Code that might throw an exception
        int numerator = 10;
        int denominator = 0;

        if (denominator == 0) {
            throw "Division by zero is not allowed.";
        }

        int result = numerator / denominator;
        cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* error_message) {
        // Handle the exception
        cout << error_message << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program continues to execute after the exception." << endl;

    return 0;
}
