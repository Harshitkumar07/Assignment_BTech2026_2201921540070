Coding Problem
Suppose you are designing a basic system to model different types of animals. There are two types of animals: Animal and Dog. Each animal has an attribute called name.

Create a base class Animal with a property name (a string).
Create a class Dog that inherits from Animal. The Dog class should have an additional property breed (a string) to represent the breed of the dog.
In the main function, create an instance of the Dog class, set its name and breed properties, and then display the name and breed of the dog.
Ensure that the base class Animal and the derived class Dog are correctly designed and that the properties are inherited and initialized properly.

Task
Given name and breed of dog as input, use display function to print the information of dog.

Input Format
First line contain the name of the dog.
Second line contain the breed of the dog.
Output Format
Print name of the dog on first line.
Print breed of the dog on second line.

** ANSWER **

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Base class Animal
class Animal {
public:
    string name;

    Animal(string name) : name(name) {}
};

// Derived class Dog
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    string breed;

    Dog(string name, string breed) : Animal(name), breed(breed) {}

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << name << endl;
        cout << breed << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    string name,breed;
    cin >> name >> breed ;
    // Create a Dog object
    Dog myDog( name , breed );

    // Display information about the Dog
    myDog.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}
