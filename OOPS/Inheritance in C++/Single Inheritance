In C++, single inheritance refers to a class inheriting from only one base class.

The given code is an example of single inheritance:

We have a base class Animal with two methods: Eat and Sleep. The Animal class has a constructor that takes the name of the animal as an argument.
We then define a derived class Dog that inherits from the Animal class using the public access specifier. This means that the public members of the Animal class are accessible in the Dog class.
The Dog class has an additional method Bark, which is specific to dogs.
In the main function, we create an instance of the Dog class named myDog and call methods from both the base class (Eat and Sleep) and the derived class (Bark) using the myDog object.

** ANSWER **

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    string name;

    Animal(string name){
        this->name = name;
    }

    void Eat() {
        cout << name << " is eating." << endl;
    }
    void sleep() {
        cout << name << " is sleeping." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class (observe the syntax)
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // calling constructor of Animal with name as parameter
    Dog(string name) : Animal(name) {}

    void Bark() {
        cout << "Woof! Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an instance of the Dog class
    Dog myDog("Buddy");

    // Call methods from the base class
    myDog.Eat();
    
    // Call methods from the base class
    myDog.sleep();

    // Call method from the derived class
    myDog.Bark();

    return 0;
}
